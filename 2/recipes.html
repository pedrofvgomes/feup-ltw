        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Francesinha is a sandwich from northern Portugal, especially the Porto region. It has two slices of bread
            and various meats, covered with melted cheese and served with sauce and fries. The sauce is a unique
            part of the sandwich, with each restaurant having its own recipe made from tomatoes, broth, piri piri
            spices, beer, and Port wine.</p>
